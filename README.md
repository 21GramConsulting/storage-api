# The Concept

Given the stable, widespread and mature interface, 
the [`Storage` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage)
we always envisioned certain use cases for the interface, besides the well-knowns:
* [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
* [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)

Why couldn't the same interface as Storage API work for in-memory data? How 
about REST API served Resources? Or even better, mediate between client-side 
persisted data and a server-side REST API without any added programmer complexity?

The vision for this project is to provide as much Storage API utilities as 
possible in hope, that one day data models handled by JavaScript / TypeScript 
apps become flexible, and interchangeable without a framework or idiomatic BS lock-in.
